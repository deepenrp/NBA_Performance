How do we measure which player is better than the next or better question how do we measure how much overall success a player brings to their team as this will determine which player will eventually win the most valuable player award at the end of the season?

According to Basketball-Reference, win shares is a metric that estimates the number of wins a player produces for his team throughout the season. We believe win shares is a very good indicator but how do we predict win shares and what is it based on - Personal Success or basic stats – ex: number of points you score, assist or rebound? Advances Stats – ex: how well you contribute to the team? Or rather a combination of basic and advanced metrics?

   - Sekou Smith: I've said all along that there's a complicated matrix of factors that go into making this vote.
   - Ian Thomsen: I love this award because it’s all about value: who has done the most for his team?
